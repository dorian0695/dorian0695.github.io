									About me
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p align="center">
								I graduated Bachelor in Mechatronics and Master in Applied Computer Science with specialty in Game Development. I had scolarship on my Master degree. I have 1 year of experience in Game Industry and 1.5 years in Web
								Applications. When I was working in PESA I was coming back home and I was learning Blender, Inkscape and Unity to start a Game Development career. In my
								previous job I was the only intern that was not studying IT and I was the only one to
								get the job offer. As I was working there I managed to finish some tasks that many
								more experienced programmers tried to. I am a person that will stay after hours to
								finish my work and to meet the deadline. If it is necessary I can also catch up with
								work on weekends.
